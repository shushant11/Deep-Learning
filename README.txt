Deep Learning introduction:
definition:- Deep Learning defines about working on complex neural network. This topic is subset of the Machine Learning.

Types of Layers in Deep Learning:

1.Input Layer- recieves the raw data to the machine
2.Hidden Layer- performs the computations in the hidden layer which is processing the data
3.Out Layer- provides the final output and prediction on calculation

Activation function in deep learning:

1.ReLU: rectified linear unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up the training of data.
2.Sigmoid: map the values in binary (0 and 1 in the layer)
3.Softmax: convert the raw data (score) into probability of the given data.

back propogation and optimisation :

in this propogation step we use some of the examples - mse(mean squared error),cross entropy stop: which optimises the data.
